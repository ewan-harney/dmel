Within this 01_interchromate_kallisto folder are 24 subdirectories, one for each RNA seq sample. 

These correspond to:
- the two populations (Akaa and Manz)
- the two generations (F3 and F6)
- the two treatments (Heat and Ctrl for F3, or HSan and Ctrl for F6)
- triplicated for each of the 2 * 2 * 2 treatments 

Abrreviations: 
Manz = Manzanares
Heat = Heat shocked (F3 only)
Ctrl = Control (F3 or F6)
HSan = Heat shocked in the ancestral generation (F6 only)

These output were generated by the InterChromaTE_rna_kallisto-index.sh and InterChromaTE_rna_kallisto-quant.sh scripts.

Within each subdirectory are the kallisto results for that sample. The results consist of "run_info.json","abundance.h5", and "abundance.tsv". 
"run_info.json" is a json file with information about the run
"abundance.h5" is a HDF5 binary file with run info, abundance esimates, bootstrap estimates, and transcript length information length
"abundance.tsv" is a plaintext file of the abundance estimates. 

See https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/manual for more information on Kallisto

The "abundance.tsv" file is used in interpareto and DESeq2 analyses.
