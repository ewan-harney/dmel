# 03_intepareto
Within this 03_interchromate_intepareto folder are 8 Rdata objects, one for each pairwise comparison:

These correspond to four experimental comparisons:
- Akaa / heat shock vs control / F3
- Manz / heat shock vs control / F3
- Akaa / ancestral heat shock vs control / F6
- Manz / ancestral heat shock vs control / F6

And four control-only comparisons
- Akaa control vs Manz control / F3
- Akaa control vs Manz control / F6
- Akaa control F3 vs Akaa control F6
- Manz control F3 vs Manz control F6

The experimental comparison objects are the basis of identifying responses to heatshock. the intergenerational controls (the final 2 described above) were used to exclude differentially expressed or differentially accessibile genes (if an effect appeared to be both associated with treatment and between generation differences). We did not use the interpopulation controls in downstream analyses, but they are provided here for completeness.

Each Rdata object contains the output of the doMatch_4 (see interchromate_scripts) and doIntegration functions from the interpareto R package.

These output were generated by the InterChromaTE_intepareto_prepTranscriptTable_250204.sh and InterChromaTE_intepareto_run_250204.R scripts.

These Rdata objects are read into the InterChromaTE_downstream_analysis_final_250203.R script.
