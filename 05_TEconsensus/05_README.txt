Within this 05_interchromate_TEconsensus folder are 6 results files combining the output of the three different TE characterisation software.

- genes_flybase_TE_F3_P1_strict_promoter_1000_den.lst
- genes_flybase_TE_F3_P1_strict_promoter_1000_ref.lst
- genes_flybase_TE_F3_P2_strict_promoter_1000_den.lst
- genes_flybase_TE_F3_P2_strict_promoter_1000_ref.lst
- TE_P1_all_insertions_and_genes.txt
- TE_P2_all_insertions_and_genes.txt

Note that Populations are referred to as P1 (Akaa) and P2 (Manz) in the file names.

The .lst files are simply lists of genes (FBgn ID) that were found to be within 1kb of transposable element insertions. The populations were considered separately as were reference (ref) and non-reference (den) insrtions (note that 'den' stands for denovo; although we did not incoroporate denovo methods, 'den' served as an intuitive 3 character label to differentiate from 'ref'). The .txt files are more comprehensive summaries, detailing reference and non-reference TEs insertions (position, name and family) and the genes that they are proximate to (within 1kb). Note that because a TE can be near multiple genes (and vice versa) TEs and genes can appear multiple times in these two summary tables.

All these files were generated by the same InterChromaTE_TEdisco_combResults_250203.sh script.

These results files are incoroprated into the downstream analysis in script InterChromaTE_downstream_analysis_final_250203.R
